# This the solution to the R-Programming task in Week 2, written R

# Part 1
# --------
#
# The task is to read in the data in the csv files and calculate the mean of the
# quantity sulfate or nitrate. Basics steps are:
# 1. Read data
# 2. Remove NAs
# 3. Compute mean()
pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id=1:332){

}

# Part 2
# --------
#
#
complete <- function(directory, id=1:332){

}

# Part 3
# --------
#
#
corr <- function(directory, threshold=0){

}

# run the functions to test them
pollutantmean()
complete()
corr()
